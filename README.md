# John (bleeding)

John the Ripper is a **fast and versatile password-cracking tool** primarily used for security auditing and recovering weak passwords. Originally developed for Unix-based systems, it has since expanded to support various platforms and a wide range of encryption formats, making it a popular choice among security professionals.

## History
John the Ripper was initially created by *Solar Designer* in 1996 as a Unix password cracker. Over the years, it has evolved into a powerful multi-platform tool that includes support for different algorithms and file formats. The **bleeding-edge** version, known as *john-bleeding*, is actively maintained and incorporates the latest features, optimizations, and patches contributed by the community.

## Features
- **Support for Multiple Formats:** Cracks various password formats, including DES, MD5, SHA-1, and more.
- **Dynamic Cracking:** Allows the creation of custom cracking modes to adapt to different scenarios.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes multiple CPU cores for efficient password cracking.
- **Community Contributions:** Regular updates from contributors worldwide enhance its capabilities and performance.

## Requirements
- Linux or Windows environment
- GCC or compatible compiler
- Basic knowledge of password security and encryption algorithms
